# Kidnapped-Vehicle-Project
n this project we will implement a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++. our particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step our filter will also get observation and control data.
#Build and run the program
 The main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.
 1- ./clean.sh
 2- ./build.sh
 3- ./run.sh
